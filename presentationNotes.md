# Storyboard /Prototype

- non-coding day again
- today might be the day you decide to become a UI/UX designer

# Todo

1. -
2. Visually draw .... suggesting the animation involved
3. defining beginning state, setting, drawing sequence of steps, to satisfaction

# UI job posting

- this might be your first UI class
- briefly sketchout what you might do as a UI designer
- makes good money, don't necessarily have to know how to code
- artsy type / graphic artists - Adobe PS/Ill - maybe this might be the path for you
- opening your eyes to this path

## typical job posting description

- Notice, have to know storyboards, mockups, wireframes - that's what we'll touch on today
- tools they use: Adobe Ill/ PS, We'll touch on Figma today
- see link to actual job posting
- knowing html/css/js is a nice-to-have but it's not necessary

# salary

- good \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$\$

# Why storyboard

- this is an example of a typical storyboard
- first used in comic book industry, later template for making films, now UI design

# Linus quote

- that is the mindset you should have as a UI designer

# Scenarios and storyboards

- 3 major reasons

1. -
2. maybe you'll discover a flaw, okay that workflow doesn't work so we should change it up
3. ...shows up later in your work...you don't want that to happen

# low-fi to hi-fi chart

- here is our path for our goals today
- brief tour starting with Stories & Scenarios
- notice: this corner-end is the low-fidelity, that's why it says quicker less effort
- this is where you always want to start. You never want to start up here (top right)
- your path should always start with low-fidelity, words, sketches, storyboards
- then you gradually go to your final working code
- So today I'm going to take you thru 3 stops: stories/scenarios, storyboards, click through prototypes (which is our in-class exercise)

# stories & scenarios / words

- typical example of how you might just use words to start your ideas - ideation phase
- this is an app that a group is brainstorming that helps riders meetup
- with words on simple sticky notes - that's how simple it is - can create a storyline to test how viable it is
- present it to other people, get feedback, make some changes, and so on
- so that's how it starts in UI/UX world

# Tips

1. ...other people will understand, especially later on in time - because when it's all in your head = fuzzy later on
2. so notice how in the prior picture, there's nothing about, click on the dropdown menu -- it's all about goals/tasks
3. -

# design funnel

- this is the famous design funnel that all UI designers know
- at the very beginning you have all these ideas
- that's why it's very large at this point, but also it's low fidelity
- then at a certain point, you'll funnel out the best ideas of those ideas -- that's why it gets smaller
- but then you have another ideation phase, how can we brainstorm with these best ideas?
- today we're focusing on the middle (for our in-class exercise)
- read quote
- the mistake that most people make is to just jump right away to Adobe PS -- that's a mistake
- reason is - it's very hard to change directions at that point. you haven't tested it.
- pivoting is easy at low-fidelity

# scenarios

- what do you do with those sticky notes
- put them on the board, get people to give feedback, voting systems via coloured stickers
- stickers represent votes by other people saying "Yes I love this idea" - this should be included in the app
- very repetitive process where you refine your ideas
- once you've finalized the scenarios and combined the best ideas -- here's the key, READ: "these scenarios become..."
- so that's how UI designers begin; with sticky notes, then go on to storyboards

# low-fi hi-fi chart

- so now we're going to move on to the 2nd one
- keep in mind again, we started off with stories/scenarios, now we're at storyboards, next will be click-thru prototypes

# todo 1.

- Scott's video is using another definition of storyboarding - which is not the typical definition that most UI designers use. I'll explain why in a moment

# Klemmer quote

- Scott Klemmer is a UI prof in U.S.
- some of you may be wondering, ya but storyboarding is all about drawing and I can't draw
- he'd say: it's more beneficial that you can't draw because it forces you to focus on the main ideas
- focus on just the task -- that's what you want at this stage

# Star ppl

- One of his famous tips that he teaches his students is to use star people (a concept he got from another prof: Verplank)
- circle with star body allows you to have the flexibility to point, gestures etc.

# setting

- Storyboards have 3 concepts
- read comic and 3 questions
- not quite yet at the interface level

# sequence

# satisfaction

# tips

1. -
2. -
3. - a lot of UI/UX designers just use pencil/paper

# Klemmer quote

- everytime Scott teaches a class, and students have gone on and graduated, graduates always come back and say, the best thing I've learned from your class is that I can rapidly prototype things on paper -- and that's what we'll be doing today

# Click thru prototypes

- again started with stories/scenarios, storyboards, and now we're here

# todo today prototypes

# paper prototyping

- we're going to talk about paper prototyping because I think that's the best way to go
- the reason why you paper prototype are 3
- read 3:

1. -
2. - I'll show you a video in a second of what that kind of looks like
3. - one thing about paper prototypes is that it's so low-fidelity that it looks like a little kid from kindergarten made it-- but that's what you want because you'll get honest feedback. Imagine if you created a high-fidelity prototype within Photoshop and showed it to somebody and asked for feedback -- they're going to be more hesitant to give you honest feedback. Whereas if you had the paper prototypes, you'd have better suggestions like 'hey I think this box would look better over here'

# IDEO mouse

- when MS was going to introduce their mouse, they hired IDEO to prototype what it should look like
- read it
- and that's what we're doing with paper prototypes -- we're holding it in your hand

# paper proto example

- so here's an example of paper prototypes, notice they're just using markers, paper
- time widget, and sliders is just one piece of paper and it's not even glued so it's movable
- this is the kind of thing UI/UX designers do all the time

# youtube vid

- show an example of that here (volume off)
- notice they have all drawings in place; all buttons in place
- they're pretending
- start with scenarios, then storyboards, then paper prototypes
- this again irons out possible errors, or confusion in the workflow
- so that's what we'll be doing today

# klemmer quote

- and that's why it's a waste of time to go from ideation to photoshop because it might be trash
- so don't waste your time

# tips

- Once you've done this phase of paper prototyping and you've gone thru that workflow...

# Pinterest

- brainstorm time
- anyone brought their pen/pencil? - i have some
- so now everyone has a pencil, storyboard template, blank sheet
- let's go to pinterest.com, most websites are like this, here's your challenge/exercise,
- it's not being marked, purely for brainstorming skills and intro to this kind of UI/UX work
- so if you're not a user, you have to create
- but if you are a user, then you're presented with a different form
- but if you forgot your password, then you're presented with a different form -- one field, email
- challenge: try to think of a way to make all these separate forms into 1 fluid animated experience
- 10 minutes, once you finish it, show it to each other at your table, and just talk about it -- use the blank piece of paper
- 10 secs left! - okay, so at this point, I want you to practice verbalizing what you drew to someone else (try to use the principles of animation vocabulary). I'll give you another 7 mins for that. [Prepare document camera]
- [Create a notepad saying, "Find a partner, and practice verbalizing what you drew to each other]
- Now that you had a chance to share, I'm curious to see your ideas, if you had commonalities
- Does anyone want to share their ideas?

# my drawing

- Here's a solution (tho this is not my idea, someone else's)
- we have 3 tabs
- what if the fields fade out depending on which tab you click on

# Pop app

- a real cool tool that I found as I was researching what to put on my slides last year was this Pop app
- let me play this for you
- You can actually draw a box around your button which then links to another picture
- So I tried that using my example (doc cam)

# lo-fi hi-fi chart

- so again, we started off today learning about using words to create stories/scenarios
- moved on to storyboards where you're not focused on the user interactions yet
- then we go to prototypes which is what we just did
- then finally we go to working code

# codepen example

- so here is someone's example of the idea I just showed you
- notice: the fields fade out/in, the button text changes

# interesting takes forms

- so this is where I got the first example, but if you scroll down thru them all, you'll be amazed
- it also has links to their codepen
- try removing all CSS to see what bare bones looks like

# Discussion 2

- time to do Blackboard work
- All you have to do is google a service/sw that allows users to develop storyboards/wireframes/prototypes
- for full marks...
- 20mins + 10 mins

# Break slides

- read Did you know links
- gestalt animation vs library staff page (my attempt at gestalt)
- my one and only claim to fame for animation right there

# todo 3

# youtube scott

- This is where Scott McCrindle put in Blackboard his 18 min video of how to do a prototype within powerpoint
- I'm going to attempt to do the same thing he does

# user interaction storyboard

- he sets up a setting/scenario
- let's create a prototype in storyboard format of the sequence of animation
- Note: the term "storyboard" here is used differently to how most UI/UX designers use it.
- because we're actually interested in how it animates (vs storyboard you aren't yet)
- then after this, I'm going to show you a different tool that you can use (Figma)
- you will have the choice between ppt, Figma, Pop app, pencil/paper (scan it send it to me), export something to me in PDF
- so I'm going to create this sequence in ppt

# demo ppt

- fyi: the end goal is in Blackboard "Example of a ppt storyboard"
- so I'm recreating this in ppt, figma etc
- so if you want to silently work on this because you already know how to do this, go ahead
- make setting page
- for 4-up page: insert iphone.jpg

- Done: you start with setting, sequence of UI, put captions, end result is satisfaction
- "storyboard" - again: do not draw dropdown menus at storyboard level
- yet in Scott's mccrindle video he's using the term 'storyboard' but it's different def'n
- he's just using storyboard template to draw interfaces
- so that's it, cool thing, you can F5 to present to client in slideshow format

# figma

- when I was doing my research, this seems to be the shiny new toy that everyone wants to use
- like Sketch (limited to Mac users), Figma is web based or client, Adobe XD
- view their homepage
- yes you can draw hi-fi stuff here, but you can also do lo-fi
- you can also share it to a client via presentation mode

- Done: show finished product
- you can present it, which is great to show to clients
- Plus Figma allows collaboration, show colleagues can comment etc

# In-class exercise

- given 3 scenarios, choose only 1 of them (search bar, tab, form). Put that in storyboard chart. Prototype on how you envision animation should be
- so if pencil/paper scan it, or ppt, or figma, or Adobe XD/whatever as long as I can see it via a link, or PDF/ppt/doc format
- Again you have a choice for your in-class
- no quiz today
- if you need more forms ...
