# Storyboard /Prototype

- non-coding day again
- today might be the day you decide to become a UI/UX designer

# Todo

1. -
2. Visually draw .... suggesting the animation involved
3. defining beginning state, setting, drawing sequence of steps, to satisfaction

# UI job posting

- this might be your first UI class
- briefly sketchout what you might do as a UI designer
- makes good money, don't necessarily have to know how to code
- artsy type / graphic artists - Adobe PS/Ill - maybe this might be the path for you
- opening your eyes to this path

## typical job posting description

- Notice, have to know storyboards, mockups, wireframes - that's what we'll touch on today
- tools they use: Adobe Ill/ PS, We'll touch on Figma today
- see link to actual job posting
- knowing html/css/js is a nice-to-have but it's not necessary

# salary

- good \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$\$

# Why storyboard

- this is an example of a typical storyboard
- first used in comic book industry, later template for making films, now UI design

# Linus quote

- that is the mindset you should have as a UI designer

# Scenarios and storyboards

- 3 major reasons

1. -
2. maybe you'll discover a flaw, okay that workflow doesn't work so we should change it up
3. ...shows up later in your work...you don't want that to happen

# low-fi to hi-fi chart

- here is our path for our goals today
- brief tour starting with Stories & Scenarios
- notice: this corner-end is the low-fidelity, that's why it says quicker less effort
- this is where you always want to start. You never want to start up here (top right)
- your path should always start with low-fidelity, words, sketches, storyboards
- then you gradually go to your final working code
- So today I'm going to take you thru 3 stops: stories/scenarios, storyboards, click through prototypes (which is our in-class exercise)

# stories & scenarios / words

- typical example of how you might just use words to start your ideas - ideation phase
- this is an app that a group is brainstorming that helps riders meetup
- with words on simple sticky notes - that's how simple it is - can create a storyline to test how viable it is
- present it to other people, get feedback, make some changes, and so on
- so that's how it starts in UI/UX world

# Tips

1. ...other people will understand, especially later on in time - because when it's all in your head = fuzzy later on
2. so notice how in the prior picture, there's nothing about, click on the dropdown menu -- it's all about goals/tasks
3. -

# design funnel

- this is the famous design funnel that all UI designers know
- at the very beginning you have all these ideas
- that's why it's very large at this point, but also it's low fidelity
- then at a certain point, you'll funnel out the best ideas of those ideas -- that's why it gets smaller
- but then you have another ideation phase, how can we brainstorm with these best ideas?
- today we're focusing on the middle (for our in-class exercise)
- read quote
- the mistake that most people make is to just jump right away to Adobe PS -- that's a mistake
- reason is - it's very hard to change directions at that point. you haven't tested it.
- pivoting is easy at low-fidelity

# scenarios

- what do you do with those sticky notes
- put them on the board, get people to give feedback, voting systems via coloured stickers
- stickers represent votes by other people saying "Yes I love this idea" - this should be included in the app
- very repetitive process where you refine your ideas
- once you've finalized the scenarios and combined the best ideas -- here's the key, READ: "these scenarios become..."
- so that's how UI designers begin; with sticky notes, then go on to storyboards

# low-fi hi-fi chart

- so now we're going to move on to the 2nd one
- keep in mind again, we started off with stories/scenarios, now we're at storyboards, next will be click-thru prototypes

# todo 1.

- Scott's video is using another definition of storyboarding - which is not the typical definition that most UI designers use. I'll explain why in a moment

# Klemmer quote

- Scott Klemmer is a UI prof in U.S.
- some of you may be wondering, ya but storyboarding is all about drawing and I can't draw
- he'd say: it's more beneficial that you can't draw because it forces you to focus on the main ideas
- focus on just the task -- that's what you want at this stage

# Star ppl

- One of his famous tips that he teaches his students is to use star people (a concept he got from another prof: Verplank)
- circle with star body allows you to have the flexibility to point, gestures etc.

# setting

- Storyboards have 3 concepts
- read comic and 3 questions
- not quite yet at the interface level

# sequence

# satisfaction

# tips

1. -
2. -
3. - a lot of UI/UX designers just use pencil/paper

# Klemmer quote

- everytime Scott teaches a class, and students have gone on and graduated, graduates always come back and say, the best thing I've learned from your class is that I can rapidly prototype things on paper -- and that's what we'll be doing today

# Click thru prototypes

- again started with stories/scenarios, storyboards, and now we're here

# todo today prototypes

# paper prototyping

- we're going to talk about paper prototyping because I think that's the best way to go
- the reason why you paper prototype are 3
- read 3:

1. -
2. - I'll show you a video in a second of what that kind of looks like
3. - one thing about paper prototypes is that it's so low-fidelity that it looks like a little kid from kindergarten made it-- but that's what you want because you'll get honest feedback. Imagine if you created a high-fidelity prototype within Photoshop and showed it to somebody and asked for feedback -- they're going to be more hesitant to give you honest feedback. Whereas if you had the paper prototypes, you'd have better suggestions like 'hey I think this box would look better over here'

# IDEO mouse

- when MS was going to introduce their mouse, they hired IDEO to prototype what it should look like
- read it
- and that's what we're doing with paper prototypes -- we're holding it in your hand

# paper proto example

- so here's an example of paper prototypes, notice they're just using markers, paper
- time widget, and sliders is just one piece of paper and it's not even glued so it's movable
- this is the kind of thing UI/UX designers do all the time
